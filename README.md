# Database explorer

## Description
Database explorer is a toolbox designed to help explore and analyze the content of a database on a given topic.

This toolbox includes functions to:
- explore the datasets contained into a database
- analyze the difference between those datasets in terms of inventories and impacts
- do some contribution analysis in terms of substances and processes (however, we lose the tree representation on these graphs)
- get an interactive dashboard to analyze the impact chain of an activity. You then get sunburst representations of respectively positive and negative impacts. Those positive and negative impacts are also represented on a waterfall. Finally, you also have an interactive sankey diagram.

## How to use it
An example notebook named "sandbox_bw25.ipynb" can be used to get started with the functionalities of dbex! 

P.S.: Originaly, functionalities were developed for brithway2 and relied on lca_algebraic, but we then switch to brightway25 and removed the reliance on lca_algebraic.
